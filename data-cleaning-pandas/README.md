Group 1 : Akim, Barbara, Gijs and Laura.

The project was aimed to clean a messy data set known as “Shark Attacks” through using data wrangling techniques (GSAF5.xls).
We first cleaned and filtered the dataset by dropping unnecessary columns that presented all Null values. Subsequently we took into consideration only the data relative to Australia and more recent years (from 2000 on).
Then we developed our Business Case goals and hypothesis in order to focus our data analysis on a narrower set of data, that we then cleaned with various techniques showed in the "functions.py" file and in the main working code called "shark_main.ipynb".
